Random Rain

Program created in processing where shapes are generated randomly with random properties and fall from the top to the bottom of the screen. Users will be able to interact with the program to modify the direction of the falling shapes. Interaction will be created through the movement of the mouse, creating a representation of the movement of the body. 
I'm interested in creating this project to learn the process of creating multiple random shapes and being able to control them through user interaction. I will potentially expand this project to a user interaction projection using microsoft Kinect, where the user controls the falling shapes based on their movements in front of the projection.

Features:
- Random falling shapes.
- User can change the direction of the shapes through mouse movement.
- Depending on the speed and movement of the mouse, the shapes will be altered in different ways.
